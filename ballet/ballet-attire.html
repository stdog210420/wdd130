                <p>Ballet shoes play an important role for safely practicing ballet movements. 
                <br>Opt for a pair of Ballet slippers rather than pointe shoes – they’re soft & easy for beginners to wear.
                <br>There are three kinds of materials to choose- satin, canvas, and leather. 
                <br>Among them, canvas are the most popular ballet shoes; on the contrary, leather ones are more expensive but rather durable. 
                <br>Satin ones are preferred for performances but the least durable.</p>

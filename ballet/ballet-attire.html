                    <p>Ballet shoes play an important role for safely practicing ballet movements. 
                        Opt for a pair of Ballet slippers rather than pointe shoes – they’re soft & easy for beginners to wear.
                        There are three kinds of materials to choose- <span class="title">satin, canvas, and leather</span>. 
                        Among them, <span class="title">canvas</span> are the most popular ballet shoes; on the contrary, 
                        <span class="title">leather</span> ones are more expensive but rather durable. 
                        <span class="title">Satin</span> ones are preferred for performances but the least durable.</p>

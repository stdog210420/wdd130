                   There are several terms used in this dance form that define the position,  steps as well as costumes.

                    <p>Pliés, French for “bend,” are a simple movement in which you bend with your knees without your heels leaving the ground.
                       A basic plié requires only a small bend, while other types like demi pliés and grand pliés involve a half bend or even full (90-degree-angle) bend of your knees.
                       When doing pliés to warm up, it’s best to do them in each ballet position—from first position to second position to fifth—to stretch a wide range of muscles. 
                       Pliés are the perfect exercise to begin a ballet warm-up, because they stretch every muscle in the legs, from your glutes to your inner thighs to your ankles. </P>

                        Then, land back in a plié. While sautés are usually done without a ballet barre, barre classes will have students do sautés with the barre to help them get the lift 
                        they need to point their toes. Sautés are a great way to engage your leg muscles and practice control in the air. </P>

      <p>You’ve probably heard it, maybe even said it yourself — “ballet is the foundation of all dance forms.”</p>
      <p>Although ballet can't include all types of dance like</p>
      <p>the centuries-old traditional/folk dance forms since it is just 400 years old, this word emphasizes “ballet’s strong training structure.”</p>
      <p>Ballet offers a strict regimen of exercises, and  “a strong gateway into [dance through] understanding “lines, mechanics and musicality.” </p>
      <p>Therefore, more and more adults come to learn ballet and see it as a weight-bearing form of exercise which strengthens muscles, promotes healthy bones and burns calories. </p>
      <p>At the same time, ballet is evolving from a noble court dance into an inclusive civilian exercise. </p>
      <p>This website is built to help the beginner step into the ballet world by introducing how to dress and explaining the vocabulary.</p>

      <p>Ballet Benefits</p>

        <p>1. Improves flexibility: Ballet training involves stretching of many major and minor muscle groups in all parts of the body; legs, arms, torso, back, neck, feet… the list goes on.
              Through increased stretching with body weight exercises (which are all ballet exercises by the way), muscles become longer, stronger and more resistant to tearing or strain.</p>
        <p>2. Tones muscles: When you dance, you use so many muscles - to balance, bend, stretch, spring and jump. Each move strengthens and shapes the muscles. This reshaping of our muscles is what we call ‘toning’.</p>
        <p>3. Improves muscle strength: The legs, back and core are the main muscle groups which will benefit from strengthening though ballet exercises but we also strengthen our arm muscles as well as neck and foot muscles.</p>
        <p>4. Lengthens muscles: Ballet focus on smaller, postural muscles and a full range of motion - which are great for making lean, well flexed muscles.</p>
        <p>5. Improves stamina: 60 minute adult ballet class is a great stamina builder. </p>
        <p>6. Improves coordination: Working your cognitive functions to coordinate your body with music, will benefit your coordination in other areas of your life. </p>
        <p>7. Improves posture: Every single exercise in a ballet class requires us to hold a strong posture and it’s at the core of every position and move.
              We hold our core/abs strong and back straight whilst breathing through the exercises. Lifting the arms through the various positions allows us to create space in the spine. </p>
        <p>8. Increased energy: As we exercise, we increase circulation which works to strengthen the heart muscle. This results in increased energy available for our body - and not just during class, for a long time afterwards too. </p>
        <p>9. Great for mindfulness and calming: The music is often beautiful and concentration on the exercises means we are in a sure state of mindfulness.</p>
        <p>10. Improves concentration: Posture, positioning, turn-out, musicality, timing, counting beats and coordination of arms, legs and feet all require concentration. 
                Not to mention remembering what the teacher told you at the start of the exercise and what he / she might be saying during!</p>
        <p>11. Increases metabolic rate: Ballet will speed up your metabolism Because it is a total body workout, it increases your circulation, breathing rate and muscular activity which all contributes to elevating your metabolism.</p>
        <p>12. Great for expression: Through our movements we can really feel the music and enjoy it’s nuances. You can use ballet to emote feelings, release stress, enjoy the freedom of movement and really express your mood.</p>
        <p>13. Improves self confidence: You will get to know your body and what it’s capable of. You’ll surprise yourself with your ability, strength and coordination and your confidence in class will improve.</p>
        <p>14. Improves balance: Core strength is at the core (excuse the pun) of balance and adult ballet is great for core strength. 
                Every time we use our balance, we improve it. We do this by strengthening the muscles required to balance and hold our positions.</p>
        <p>15. Assists with lymph drainage: Exercise helps to promote lymph drainage which helps with detoxification, muscle and tissue regeneration, reduces inflammation, aids sleep, shifts cellulite and even has anti-aging effects!</p>
        <p>16. Releases endorphins: It’s been proven that ballet (and other forms of dance) release more endorphins than other forms of aerobic exercise.</p>
        <p>17. Improves breathing: Breathing during ballet is important. Breathing properly is essential for muscle health, circulation, flexibility and fluidity.</p>
        <p>18. Burns calories: In a typical 60 minute ballet class, you will burn 300 to 400 calories.</p>
        <p> Fends off dementia: Ballet is a mental workout as well as a physical one and this helps our minds stay sharp and elastic.</p>
        <p> Keeps bones strong: Because ballet is a weight-bearing exercise, it helps bones to grow healthy and increase in strength.</p>

      <h3>Ballet attire</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Ballet is all about discipline, grace, elegance and strength.To do that, evey ballet studio has its own rules. However, there are some common senses for the attire.
        <br>Subsequently, we will introduce how to wear comfortable, form-fitting clothing and proper shoes.
      </p>
      <p>Ballet attire</p>            
      <p>First, you can choose to wear a leggings with a cap sleeve or sleeveless tops shown as the above home image, or tights with a leotard and a sheer wrap skirt shown as the right image.
         The dress code is you have to make room for better flexibility, plus it also helps minimise the risk of sustaining injury by keeping the leg muscles warm. 
         Moreover, it will make your teachers see your alignment, allowing them to correct the next steps compared to baggy clothes, hiding poor practices.
      <br>Second, don't wear jewelry or a wristwatch to dance class since it may fly off while you are moving and hit someone. Additionally, it impair technique.
      <br>Third, choose a suitable soft ballet shoes if you are a beginner.
      <br>Fourth, tie your hair secured back and off the face to avoid interfering with steps like pirouettes or jumps. </P>
      <p>How to tie a basic ballet bun</p>
      <p>A ballet bun is quite simple to do. With a little practice, you will get the perfect “cinnamon bun”.
        <br>1. Brush your hair. To start, get your hair free of tangles.
        <br>2. Pull your hair back into a ponytail and secure with an elastic. 
        <br>3. Twist the bun into a rope and wrap the rope in a circle around the elastic. Wrap the rope around in a circle around the elastic.
        <br>4. Use hairpins to secure the bun to your head. Secure the bun to your head using U-shaped hair pins not bobby pins to grab hair from the top of your bun.
        <br>5. Wrap the hair net around the bun and secure with more pins to secure all the loose hairs. Cover your bun with a hair net that matches your hair color to keep all wisps and stray hairs in place.
        <br>6. Use hairspray, gel, or bobby pins / clips to tame the loose hairs away from your face. For an extra hold and overall neat look, use hairspray to slick all the loose wisps or fizz from your hairline flat on the head.           
      </p>
      <p>How to buy shoes</p>
      <p>Ballet shoes play an important role for safely practicing ballet movements. 
        <br>Opt for a pair of Ballet slippers rather than pointe shoes – they’re soft & easy for beginners to wear.
        <br>There are three kinds of materials to choose- satin, canvas, and leather. 
        <br>Among them, canvas are the most popular ballet shoes; on the contrary, leather ones are more expensive but rather durable. 
        <br>Satin ones are preferred for performances but the least durable.</p>

      <h3>Ballet Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Ballet has evolved into a popular and highly professional dance form with its vocabulary. The vocabulary of ballet has mainly stayed in French, and been learned and communicated by ballet professional dancers from all over the universe.
        <br>There are several terms used in this dance form that define the position,  steps as well as costumes.
        <br> For more, you can look up the website: https://www.inspireddance.org/dance-terms-and-exercises/dance-ballet-vocabulary?ssp_iabi=1677277102448
        <br>Hand Positions
        <br> 1. First Position: arms held out in front of the body with rounded elbows in an oval shape, sloping down from the shoulders.
        <br> 2. Second Position: arms held out to the sides, horizontal with a slight slope downwards from shoulders to wrist.
        <br> 3. Third Position: one arm held forward in first position, the other arm held to the side in second position
        <br> 4. Fourth Position: one arm held to the side in second position, the other arm raised up above the head, held slightly forward.
        <br> 5. Fifth Position:  both arms raised up above the head, held slightly forward
        <br>Feet Positions
        <br> 1. First Position: heels together, toes pointed outwards to the side.
        <br> 2. Second Position: legs are moved apart, hip width apart, toes pointed outwards to the side
        <br> 3. Third Position: feet pointed outwards, one foot placed in front of the other with front heel touching the back foot’s instep
        <br> 4. Fourth Position: 
            <br>Open: feet pointed outwards, with legs in third position but spread apart
            <br>Crossed: feet pointed outwards, legs spread apart with one foot placed in front of the other, and the front foot is placed opposite the toes of the back foot
        <br>5. Fifth Position: feet pointed outwards, legs crossed and feet touching, with the heel of one foot placed beside the toes of the other
        <br>
        <br>6 Basic Ballet Exercises
        <br>1. Port de bras
        <br>Carriage of the arms. In general, the use or movement of the arms through either specified classical positions 
        or as they are placed in choreography. Excellent move to improve your posture, tone the arms and back muscles. 
        <br>2. Pile
        <br>Pliés, French for “bend,” are a simple movement in which you bend with your knees without your heels leaving the ground.
        A basic plié requires only a small bend, while other types like demi pliés and grand pliés involve a half bend or even full (90-degree-angle) bend of your knees.
        When doing pliés to warm up, it’s best to do them in each ballet position—from first position to second position to fifth—to stretch a wide range of muscles. 
        Pliés are the perfect exercise to begin a ballet warm-up, because they stretch every muscle in the legs, from your glutes to your inner thighs to your ankles.
        <br>3. Elevés and relevés
        <br>Elevés and relevés are two movements in which you raise your heels from the floor, rolling up onto the balls of your feet—elevés from one of the five ballet positions,
        and relevés from a plié position. Elevés and relevés strengthen your feet, ankles, and calves and are a great foundation for pirouettes and work in pointe shoes.
        <br>4. Tendu
        <br>To perform a tendu, French for stretch, begin in either first or fifth position and slowly brush your working foot outward until it rests in a strong point away from you. 
        Then, brush your foot back toward you and bring it back to your starting position. Tendus can be done to the front (devant), to the side (à la seconde), 
        or to the back (derriére), and they stretch leg muscles and help improve turnout (outward rotation of your legs and feet).
        <br>5. Dégagés
        <br>Dégagés are a similar movement to a tendu, in which you extend your working foot outward, but for a dégagé, your foot should be slightly off of the floor. 
        Dégagés can be done to the front, to the side, or to the back, and they stretch leg muscles and help improve turnout.
        <br>6. Rond de jambe
        <br>A rond de jambe, which literally means “circular movement of the leg,” is done by using your working leg to make a semi-circular movement across the floor, 
        either from your front to your back or vice versa. Rond de jambes stretch your hip muscles and help improve turnout.      
        <br>7. Sautés
        <br>The sauté is the simplest jumping step in ballet. To do a sauté, begin with a plié, then leap upward so that both feet are in a pointed position in the air. 
        Then, land back in a plié. While sautés are usually done without a ballet barre, barre classes will have students do sautés with the barre to help them get the lift 
        they need to point their toes. Sautés are a great way to engage your leg muscles and practice control in the air.
        <br>

        <br>Music for Ballet
        <br>allet has evolved into a popular and highly professional dance form with its vocabulary. The vocabulary of ballet has mainly stayed in French, and been learned and communicated by ballet professional dancers from all over the universe.

      explaining the ballet terms, introducing ballet class music, and so on. </p>
      <p>This website is going to provide the information for the ballet amateurs.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        You’ve probably heard it, maybe even said it yourself — “ballet is the foundation of all dance forms.”
        <br> Although ballet can't include all types of dance like
        the centuries-old traditional/folk dance forms since it is just 400 years old, this word emphasizes “ballet’s strong training structure.”
        <br>Ballet offers a strict regimen of exercises, and  “a strong gateway into [dance through] understanding “lines, mechanics and musicality.” 
        <br>Therefore, more and more adults come to learn ballet and see it as a weight-bearing form of exercise which strengthens muscles, promotes healthy bones and burns calories. 
        <br>At the same time, ballet is evolving from a noble court dance into an inclusive civilian exercise. 
        <br>This website is built to help the beginner step into the ballet world by introducing how to dress and explaining the vocabulary.

        <p>Ballet shoes play an important role for safely practicing ballet movements. 
          <br>Opt for a pair of Ballet slippers rather than pointe shoes – they’re soft & easy for beginners to wear.
          <br>There are three kinds of materials to choose- satin, canvas, and leather. 
          <br>Among them, canvas are the most popular ballet shoes; on the contrary, leather ones are more expensive but rather durable. 
          <br>Satin ones are preferred for performances but the least durable.

      <h3>Ballet Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Ballet has evolved into a popular and highly professional dance form with its vocabulary. The vocabulary of ballet has mainly stayed in French, and been learned and communicated by ballet professional dancers from all over the universe.
        <br>There are several terms used in this dance form that define the position,  steps as well as costumes.
